JRC-1
=====

The JRC-1 (Josh's Retro Computer 1) the first in my new series of homebrew
retro computers. It is the first in the JRC series and is the successor to
COLE-1 and COLE-2.

The primary goal for this project is to scale back some of the lofty goals set
for its predecessor, and instead provide some limited expansion capabilities
so that features can be added iteratively down the road.
